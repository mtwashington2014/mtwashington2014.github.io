Accommodation Info:
Cost breakdown for each person:
$30/night for people who are staying 3 nights
$35/night for people staying 2 nights
$40/night for people staying 1 night

We need to rent the chalet for at least 2 nights so this will keep it cheap for everyone that plans on going. Also, this will still be way cheaper than breaking up into smaller groups (for the people who just plan to stay 1 night).

More Accommodation Info:
- no smoking
- no pets
- low on blankets so bring sleeping bags
- check-in at 5:00 pm, check-out at 4:30 pm
- we have the nights of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday March 14th-16th
- we can make colored copies of our parking permit and park in the Henry Road parking lot
